   <h2>My True Start: From Gaming Dreams to Code Passion</h2>
   <hr>
   <p>My journey into programming didn't begin with a textbook—it started with gaming. I was always captivated by the complex worlds, engaging stories, and intricate design of video games. I remember thinking, "I don't just want to play these; I want to build them." That initial curiosity sparked the idea of becoming a game designer.

However, as I started learning the basics, something unexpected happened. My interest in just playing games faded, but my fascination with the underlying code and the process of creation exploded.

It was the feeling of taking an abstract idea and transforming it into a functional piece of software—that was the real hook. Now, the goal isn't just to build games, but to become a Software Engineer and dedicate myself to solving complex problems with elegant code.

Coding is my true passion. It’s not just a skill; it’s where I find my greatest focus and happiness. Every challenge is an opportunity to learn, and I genuinely enjoy spending my time bringing digital solutions to life. This journey is just beginning, and I’m committed to giving it my all.</p>
